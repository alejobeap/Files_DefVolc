1. Prepare Data
  1.1 Firts use the LicSBAS commands to extrat the tif files e.g.
    Velocity:
      LiCSBAS_cum2vel.py -i TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/cum_filt.h5 --vstd --mask TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/results/mask --png
      LiCSBAS_flt2geotiff.py -i 2*.vel.mskd -p TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/info/EQA.dem_par
    Cumulative:
      LiCSBAS_cum2flt.py -i TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/cum_filt.h5 --mask TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/results/mask --png
      LiCSBAS_flt2geotiff.py -i 2*.cum -p TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/info/EQA.dem_par
  These will give you the tifs in WGS84 Lat and Lon in degrees.
  1.2 Change to UTM the tif
      Normally I open it in QGIS and save it in UTM, but you can use gdal to do it automatically.
  1.3 DEM preparation
      The topography is also needed in UTM and the area must be at least 4 times the area of the volcano.
      In the same way I do it in QGIS, I open the Copernicus DEM in degrees I see the area of my velocity tif that I generated before and I save it four times bigger than my DEM.
