1. Prepare Data
  1.1 Firts use the LicSBAS commands to extrat the tif files e.g.
    Velocity:
      LiCSBAS_cum2vel.py -i TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/cum_filt.h5 --vstd --mask TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/results/mask --png
      LiCSBAS_flt2geotiff.py -i 2*.vel.mskd -p TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/info/EQA.dem_par
    Cumulative:
      LiCSBAS_cum2flt.py -i TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/cum_filt.h5 --mask TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/results/mask --png
      LiCSBAS_flt2geotiff.py -i 2*.cum -p TS_GEOCml1_volcano_mask/info/EQA.dem_par
  These will give you the tifs in WGS84 Lat and Lon in degrees.
  1.2 Change to UTM the tif and save as HDR format
      Normally I open it in QGIS and save it in UTM in tif format and hdr format, but you can use gdal to do it automatically.
  1.3 DEM preparation
      The topography is also needed in UTM and the area must be at least 4 times the area of the volcano.
      In the same way I do it in QGIS, I open the Copernicus DEM in degrees I see the area of my velocity tif that generated before and save it four times bigger than my DEM in tif format and hdr format.
  1.4 pyhton code UTMTIF_2_r4_format.py
      Use the python code to save the UTM tif to r4 format.
      In the script the input files are
      UTM tifs
        121A_090_UTM.tif
        040D_088_UTM.tif
        DEM.tif
      Outputs r4 files
        ASC_utm.r4
        DESC_utm.r4
        hgt_utm.r4
    1.5 In step 1.3 and 1.2 it was saved as hdr format you must put the same names as your r4 files, also inside the hdr file you must change the name of the file in the field
        e.g.
        description = {
        ASC_utm.r4} 


        For each Ascendning, Descendning and DEM files
    1.6 INSAR.txt file input

          This file contains the average values of the U, N and E components of the incidence and heading angles, you can get them from the LiCSAR files, but attached for tracks 142, 40 Descendning and 18 and 121 for Ascending.
